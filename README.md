# Implementing_
Here's were I try and build some cool stuff from scratch inorder to better understand them. <br>

<H4> 1.Build a neural net from scratch only NumPy</H4><br>
      Dependencies to run this code :<br>
      
* Numpy(numerical computational library)
* sklearn(for a dataset to train and test the network)

If you dont have the dependencies installed type the following in your command line:
*    $pip3 install numpy
*    $pip3 install sklearn

Link to code below.

<H4> 2.A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style- Leon A. Gatys,Alexander S. Ecker,Matthias Bethge</H4>https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576 <br>
Learnt a lot along the way.From Tensorflow Eager Execution to Gram Matrix.<br>
I've tried my best to document and comment each step along the way.<br>You can run this directly on Google colab ,link

[here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Pythonista7/Implementing_/blob/master/The_Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb)
In this case I suggest to work on google colab with a GPU runtime as we get both the hardware and there is no hassle to setup the dependencies.
<br>

Here are some sample results(This is not the best implementation):<br>
